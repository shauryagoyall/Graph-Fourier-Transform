# Implementation of approx GFT

This repository contains the python code I had written while working with the approximate fast graph fourier transform. The code is based off the paper "Approximate fast graph Fourier transforms via multi-layer sparse approximations" [arXiv:1612.04542](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04542v3). Approx_GFT.py corresponds to figure 2 and Parallel_Approx_GFT.py corresponds to figure 4 in the paper respectively.
